# Summary

Arduino Nano Clone Dummy Model

MEASURED FROM MY CLONE BOARD: APPROXIMATELY RIGHT - Not drawn from the internet "Mech Drawing" - http://www.slideshare.net/clickengenharia/arduino-nanomanual23 - I don't think that's the official Arduino mech sizes, but it's not the same as I measured. So please beware. Check your Arduino Nano dimensions against this and the drawing to see which matches better.

Though the drawing doesn't give standard dot pitches of the solder points - which most will have - so I guess the drawing is wrong - but make your own mind up!

Dummy for sizing up and building a case.

When I say "Building a Case" I don't mean like a class action against Just3DPrint in Philidelphia. I mean a printable case for my daughter's science project.

It involves a Arduino Nano and a LCD Screen Sheild from a Nokia.

I bought a cheap one, and it gets a little funny with the contrast sometimes, I've no idea if its the Cheap Arduino Nano Clone or the cheap Nokia LCD Style Shield. It may just be a duff USB Power Supply - but either way something is messed up a little.

DON'T PRINT. NOT AVAILABLE FOR JUSTPRINT3D TO PUT ON eBAY.

p.s. A lot of Arduinos out there are Clones, I believe they are tolerated by the developers. Many of these have cheaper chipsets and Power regulators (where applicable) - you do get what you pay for.
However, in light of the whole @JPI Just3D Print (Philadelphia) thing, I'd urge any Arduino users out there to DONATE to the Arduino cause:
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Donate
For the cost of a coffee you can avoid being the next Will Davey / Matthew Andraka et al over at Wharton's Spin out Just3D Print.

Help Arduino developers "make end meat".
